# Flipping-coins

Create a program to simulate the coin flipping algorithm outlined in the previous video.

Print a list containing the positions (not indices) of the coins that remain heads up when simulated with 1000 coins.
(The output should be of the form [1, 4, 9])


A reminder about the workings of the algorithm:

    - Start with N coins heads up.

    - Flip the 2nd, 4th, 6th... coin.

    - Flip the 3rd, 6th, 9th... coin.

    - Flip the 4th, 8th, 12th... coin.

      ...

    - Flip the nth coin.

    - Take note of the final configuration of the coins.
